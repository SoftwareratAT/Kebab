## Kebab-Common
**Basically here to avoid circular dependencies.**

This module contains helper classes used in `kebab-server` and `kebab-api`.

**Please don't use this module in your plugins!** Everything here could change in the future.
If you need some feature that is not implemented in the api, feel free to create a feature-request in the issues section.
