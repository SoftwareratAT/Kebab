## Kebab-Server
**Here comes the real magic!**

This module contains the server software itself. Everything from `kebab-api` gets implemented here.

**Please don't use this module in your plugins!** Everything here could change in the future. 
If you need some feature that is not implemented in the api, feel free to create a feature-request in the issues section.
